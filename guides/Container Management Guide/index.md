## Intro to the blendOS container manager

The container manager is **unfinished**, so some features will be missing, this guide will be updated as features are added.

Along the top are your **containers**, which act as a sort of distro in a distro. From here you can start, reorder (more on that later), or delete them

Stop/Restart buttons coming soon!
