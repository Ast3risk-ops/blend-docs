### Step 3: Burn the ISO to your USB drive.

:::danger

Make sure to select the correct USB drive, as balenaEtcher will **erase** all the files on the drive.

<div class="gap"></div>

Click on **Flash from file**, and select the ISO file you downloaded earlier. You can then select the USB drive you would like to flash the ISO drive to. After
selecting the drive, you can click on **Flash** to flash/burn the ISO to the USB drive.

### Step 4: Boot from the USB drive.

:::info

The computer you used to flash the ISO file to the USB drive may be the same as the computer you want to install blendOS.

:::

<div class="gap"></div>

Insert the USB drive into the computer that you wish to install blendOS to, and power it off. After a few seconds, power it on and hold the <kbd>F12</kbd> until you arrive at your computer's boot menu. If that doesn't work, you may also try <kbd>F10</kbd>, <kbd>Esc</kbd>, or <kbd>F2</kbd>.

Once at the boot menu, select the USB drive you flashed blendOS to. You will be greeted by another menu, where you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to proceed with booting the live installation media.

### Step 5: Installing

:::info

You may see some flashing text come up during boot, it's normal! (Just a Linux thing)

:::

You should arrive at the **desktop**, which should look like this:



#### GNOME:
