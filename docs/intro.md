# blendOS 

blendOS is an **immutable operating system** and a seamless blend of all **Linux distributions**, **Android apps** and **web apps**.

It employs a special architecture to implement immutability, that works really well and is extremely stable. Read more about it on the [blendOS Architecture](/docs/system/architecture.md) documentation page.
