# System Installer

blendOS has implemented its own installer framework, `blend-inst`, written in Python. It's inspired by Crystal Linux's `jade` installer, which is written in Rust, but unlike it, `blend-inst` uses the squashfs provided by the live ISO, and doesn't bootstrap a whole new Arch installation, in a speedy installation time of around 2-3 minutes with a decent internet connection (tested with a 400Mbps internet connection in Bangalore, India).
